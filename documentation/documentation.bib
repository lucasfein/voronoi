abstract="Voronoi tessellations have been used to model the geometric arrangement of cells in morphogenetic or cancerous tissues, however, so far only with flat hyper-surfaces as cell-cell contact borders. In order to reproduce the experimentally observed piecewise spherical boundary shapes, we develop a consistent theoretical framework of multiplicatively weighted distance functions, defining generalized finite Voronoi neighborhoods around cell bodies of varying radius, which serve as heterogeneous generators of the resulting model tissue. The interactions between cells are represented by adhesive and repelling force densities on the cell contact borders. In addition, protrusive locomotion forces are implemented along the cell boundaries at the tissue margin, and stochastic perturbations allow for non-deterministic motility effects. Simulations of the emerging system of stochastic differential equations for position and velocity of cell centers show the feasibility of this Voronoi method generating realistic cell shapes. In the limiting case of a single cell pair in brief contact, the dynamical nonlinear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process is analytically investigated. In general, topologically distinct tissue conformations are observed, exhibiting stability on different time scales, and tissue coherence is quantified by suitable characteristics. Finally, an argument is derived pointing to a tradeoff in natural tissues between cell size heterogeneity and the extension of cellular lamellae.",

title="Finding faces in a planar embedding of a graph",
year="2015",
abstract="Planar graphs are frequently used to analyze morphological properties of networks occurring in complex systems. In these networks, an important task is to successfully extract the faces. We introduce a versatile algorithm to extract the faces of a planar embedding of a graph. With a focus on developmental biology and urban street patterning, we apply the algorithm to extracting cells from tissue graphs and areas of building density from urban street networks. We present the theory as well as other possible situations where the algorithm can be very useful.",

abstract = "During morphogenesis, cells push and pull each other to trigger precise deformations of a tissue to shape the body. Therefore, to understand the development of animal forms, it is essential to analyze how mechanical forces coordinate behaviors of individual cells that underlie tissue deformations. However, the lack of a direct and non-invasive force-measurement method has hampered our ability to identify the underlying physical principles required to regulate morphogenesis. In this study, by employing Bayesian statistics, we develop a novel inverse problem framework to estimate the pressure of each cell and the tension of each contact surface from the observed geometry of the cells. We confirmed that the true and estimated values of forces fit well in artificially generated data sets. Moreover, estimates of forces in Drosophila epithelial tissues are consistent with other readouts of forces obtained by indirect or invasive methods such as laser-induced destruction of cortical actin cables. Using the method, we clarify the developmental changes in the patterns of tensile force in the Drosophila dorsal thorax. In summary, the batch and noninvasive nature of the described force-estimation method will enable us to analyze the mechanical control of morphogenesis at an unprecedented quantitative level."

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a non-invasive tool for the monitoring of gene therapy for muscular dystrophy. The clinical investigations for this family of diseases often involve surgical biopsy which limits the amount of information that can be obtained due to the invasive nature of the procedure. Thus, other non-invasive tools may provide more opportunities for disease assessment and treatment responses. In order to explore this, dystrophic mdx4cv mice were systemically treated with a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing a codon-optimized micro-dystrophin gene. Multi-parametric MRI of T2, magnetization transfer, and diffusion effects alongside 3-D volume measurements were then utilized to monitor disease/treatment progression. Mice were imaged at 10 weeks of age for pre-treatment, then again post-treatment at 8, 16, and 24 week time points. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by physiological assays for improvements in function and quantification of expression. Tissues from the hindlimbs were collected for histological analysis after the final time point for comparison with MRI results. We found that introduction of the micro-dystrophin gene restored some aspects of normal muscle histology and pathology such as decreased necrosis and resistance to contraction-induced injury. T2 relaxation values showed percentage decreases across all muscle types measured (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus) when treated groups were compared to untreated groups. Additionally, the differences between groups were statistically significant for the tibialis anterior as well. The diffusion measurements showed a wider range of percentage changes and less statistical significance while the magnetization transfer effect measurements showed minimal change. MR images displayed hyper-intense regions of muscle that correlated with muscle pathology in histological sections. T2 relaxation, alongside diffusion and magnetization transfer effects provides useful data towards the goal of non-invasively monitoring the treatment of muscular dystrophy.},
